### Problem
> The 8-queens puzzle is the problem of placing 8 queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that no two 
> queens attack each other. There are multiple solutions and the following is one solution to the 
> problem. In this homework, you need to design a brute-force algorithm and implement it using 
> either C++/Java to find one solution. The program should display the eight queues positions either
> in text or in a graphic format.

### Pseudo Code
    
    FUNCTION solve(index = 0)
        IF all queens have been found THEN
            you're done, stop recursion.
        ELSE
            FOR size of the game board
                IF this spot cannot be attacked by an existing queen THEN
                    place a queen here
                    do some recursion, solve(index + 1) 
                END IF
            END FOR
        END IF

### Solution
This is the basic algorithm, there will need to be more. For starters another function for 
`this spot cannot be attacked by an existing queen`. This implementation makes use of the fact each 
row must have a queen. If all the spots in the next row are attackable by an existing queen the 
`FOR size of the game board` loop will try the next spot in the previous row.

For this project I did study the [solutions][2] [implemented][3] [by][4] [others][5]. In doing so I
realized how easy it was to alter my function that returns the one solution into a function that
returns all solutions. Moving to user inputted nxn instead of 8x8 was trivial (compared to the time 
I'm ashamed to admit it took me to figure out the solution logic). With further tweaking I came to 
realize the game board can be represented by a single dimension array by using the index as columns.

I moved to a class structure to make use of class-wide variables, and I feel passing arrays into
functions to be a messy process in C++. This is also the first program I've written to make use of a
`makefile`, albeit it is overkill.

### Implementation
It can be cloned from git and compiled with the `makefile`, just type;
    
    git clone https://github.com/deplicator/n-Queens
    cd n-Queens
    make
    
alternative to make is to compile with g++;

    g++ main.cpp nQueen.cpp -o queens.exe
    
or `main.cpp`, `nQueens.cpp`, and `nQueens.h` can be copied and pasted into Visual Studios (this has
been tested in Visual Studios 2010).

Default execution will display all solutions for an 8x8 game board. Appending a number behind the 
execution command will display all solutions for nxn board. For example:

    ./queens.exe 10

Will return the 724 solutions for a 10x10 board. The program has only been tested to 13x13; expect 
results of higher n's take several minutes. It should be noted there is little data validation on 
this. The program will not allow for numbers higher than 26 (alphabetical display limitations) and 
anything other than numbers will yield unexpected results.

It can be beneficial to send the output to a text file. The output is bulky (some examples in 
[git repository][git]), running the program with an n of 13 will yield a ~130 MB file.

    ./queens 9.exe > results.txt

 **  Output time in result text file running in an Ubuntu 13.10 virtual machine on an Intel Corei7.
     Results in terminal will take longer.  
 *** Stopped test, was taking too long and too much space.

### Future Development
I thought it would be nice to add more command line switches that tweak the output. An option to 
return only the queen coordinates, instead and an entire board, should reduce the output size. Also,
an option to change to coordinate system to use only numbers instead of the chessboard number/letter
standard it outputs now. No doubt there is plenty of room for efficiency improvement.

### Interesting Notes
I included the timing results to make it more interesting, but discovered a notable difference 
between Linux versus Windows.

Running in Linux gave the same (or at least very close to) amount of time passed for running in a 
terminal or outputting to a file. It was also very obvious in the Linux terminal the time displayed 
was not how long it took the terminal to display the results. For example, running queen 12x12 in 
the terminal showed 0.94 seconds to complete, but I observed it taking several seconds to complete. 
My theory is the computations are finished in 0.94 seconds, but it takes longer to print 14 thousand
text boards.

Under Windows, running an 8x8 solution would take 2.587 seconds in the command window. Outputting 
the result to a file showed it took 0.023 seconds. This leads me to believe (but by no means is 
conclusive), Windows takes into account the time to display results but runs about the same as 
Linux.

This is anecdotal; there are several factors not taken into consideration, but still no less
interesting.
